## Ping Pong ELO

A React application that calculates and keeps track of ELO rating for office ping pong. This app could theoretically be used for any competitive event in which you would like to keep track of an ELO rating for your players, however I'm keeping the scope small for now and simply hard coding in a list of players.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
